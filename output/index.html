    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-27">2013-03-27</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>Here’s a cute solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz">Fizz-Buzz</a> 
that occurred to me when I read about the 
<code>unless</code> statement in Ruby; it uses only the unless statement. 
I’m doing the Bitmaker Labs workshop, and one of the questions for the
interview was Fizz-Buzz. </p>

<p>I call it “by exhaustion” because, instead of using <code>if</code>-statements to look for 
which terms to include, it uses <code>unless</code>-statements to look for which terms
to exclude (until all possibilities are exhausted, in which case it just
gives up and says “Let’s just assume it’s ‘Buzz’”).</p>

    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-27">2013-03-27</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>Not many. But not due to a lack of quality music, but due to a change in 
culture.</p>

<p>Rock stars, in the traditional sense, were the product of a world in which 
independent media, for all intents and purposes, did not exist.</p>

<p>There will never be another Beatles, because today, a band of such caliber would 
most likely go to an independent label, where they can have full control of, not 
only their music, but their careers. In fact, they might not sign with a label 
at all, but self release instead.</p>

<p>There still are exceptions: great modern bands that go the big label route 
(The Strokes, Queens of the Stone Age, The Mars Volta), but even they live at 
the margins of what one would consider popular music… sometimes even 
abandoning it altogether (Radiohead). </p>

<p>Today, big labels are in the business of producing the hit of the summer, 
not the album of the decade (which would be fine by me, if they weren’t also in 
the business of ruining people with lawsuits). </p>

<p>People now have the power to find their own music on their own terms, 
without the help of radio critics. – When was the last time <em>you</em> cared what a 
professional music critic had to say? </p>

<p>Music fans (over the age of 14) simply don’t care about charts, because all the 
talented musicians are flocking to smaller labels, and self-publishing.</p>

<p>There are so many options now, so many niches, that music is no longer about the 
massive, continent-sweeping phenomena it was about up until the mid-90’s. </p>

<p>Back then, we’d ALL flock to whatever actual talent managed to fight its way to 
the top of the big-media approved charts. What other option did we have? 
Today, music is much more of a personal experience; it’s about small communities 
of loyal followers, not giant mobs filling up stadiums; and, in three decades, 
you’ll all remember the music that mattered to <em>you</em>, not everyone else.</p>

  </p></article><article class="front-page"><h2><a href="/articles/bureaucratic_bloat/">Bureaucratic Bloat</a></h2>
    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-26">2013-03-26</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>Bureaucratic bloat is the organizational equivalent of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">software bloat</a>. </p>

<p>Bureaucracies fetter the most productive members of an organization by impeding
them from exercising their creativity and best judgement. To make matters worse, 
within a bureaucratic institution, the atmosphere is such that advantage is most 
easily gained not by fostering progress, but by gaming the system.</p>

<p>Individuals “rise to the top” most easily when they stifle the advancement of 
others. These individuals will abuse the inflexible institutional rule-sets and 
hierarchies, and use them as roadblocks with which to slow down their 
competitors. At the same time, they will take advantage of the many 
loopholes that inevitably arise within bureaucracies. </p>

<p>This is not, as some would argue, “an unfortunate, but inevitable consequence of 
the human character, for which there is no getting around,” but, rather, it is 
an inextricable property of pyramidal hierarchies. </p>

<p>A second inevitable consequence is 
<a href="/articles/dysfunctional_institutions_and_policy">the bureaucratic positive feedback loop</a>:</p>

<p>When the gaming of regulatory loopholes becomes pandemic, we fool ourselves into
believing that the problem of inefficient policy must be remedied by… 
what else, but the introduction of <em>more</em> policy! </p>

<p>(In other words: 
more loopholes to be exploited by charlatans, and more roadblocks for 
innovators.)</p>

<p>This is bureaucratic entropy. And fighting entropy is a losing battle. <strong>To expect
new policy to make more efficient an institution that is already mired by
inefficient policy, is to expect an egg to become less scrambled if only we
turn up the heat and stir faster!</strong></p>

  <article class="front-page"><h2><a href="/articles/specificity_of_policy_as_a_marker_of_organizational_dysfunction/">Specificity of Policy as a Marker of Organizational Dysfunction</a></h2>
    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-26">2013-03-26</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>A reasonable metric for estimating the robustness of a group is how
specifically its policies are worded. </p>

<p>I argue that this is an inverse relationship: the 
more punctilious its law books, the more dysfunctional an institution is 
likely to be. </p>

<p>When a group is well-organized, there is no need for oversight. From personal
experience, we know that our healthiest partnerships
can operate successfully for long periods of time without anyone finding the 
need to introduce some inflexible set of rules of conduct. </p>

<p>There is no need
to meddle in the minutia of how this or that partner is to behave at all times,
because communication is strong and the team is productive. A mere tacit 
understanding of each partner’s strengths and boundaries will 
suffice. At most, a written list of general guidelines. </p>

<p>It is only when trust, communication, and morale begin to break down that we
perceive the need to introduce strict policies, carefully worded rules of proper
and improper conduct, and, of course, arbitrary ranks of authority. </p>

<p>I say “perceive” because, in practice, these regulatory measures are not only
corrosive, but, in fact, engender 
<a href="/articles/bureaucratic_bloat">a bureaucratic positive feedback loop</a>
out of which the organization cannot break, and which eventually permeates the 
culture so fundamentally that the organization becomes too inefficient 
to operate at all… this is the organizational equivalent of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">software bloat</a>.</p>

<p>We can follow this trend by starting with the example of a healthy, productive 
partnerships. Even a friendship, perhaps. – These relationships are invariably 
anarchistic. If a husband were to demand from his wife that she ask permission 
to leave her 
home, based on some arbitrary claim to authority, we’d say that husband is 
overbearing. If the wife were to begin making unreasonable demands of her husband,
and ask that he follow this and that rule, with no explanation as to why, 
we’d say she is too controlling. </p>

<p>We immediately recognize that the healthiest, most robust partnerships are those
marked not by efficient policy, but by a <em>lack</em> thereof. Not because rules of 
conduct are a bad thing in and of themselves, but because we understand that, 
when communication is strong, <em>there is no need</em> to explicitly define those 
rules.</p>

<p>To continue our thought experiment, we now climb down the ladder of 
organizational robustness, lower and lower, until we reach the very bottom:</p>

<p>We have before us the most inflexible, micro-managerial and arbitrarily 
hierarchical institutions our society has to offer; which, not surprisingly, 
are also the most dysfunctional and ineffective I could think to name: <strong>our 
prisons, our governments, and our schools.</strong></p>

    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-26">2013-03-26</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>Bureaucratic bloat is the organizational equivalent of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">software bloat</a>. </p>

<p>Bureaucracies fetter the most productive members of an organization by impeding
them from exercising their creativity and best judgement. To make matters worse, 
within a bureaucratic institution, the atmosphere is such that advantage is most 
easily gained not by fostering progress, but by gaming the system.</p>

<p>Individuals “rise to the top” most easily when they stifle the advancement of 
others. These individuals will abuse the inflexible institutional rule-sets and 
hierarchies, and use them as roadblocks with which to slow down their 
competitors. At the same time, they will take advantage of the many 
loopholes that inevitably arise within bureaucracies. </p>

<p>This is not, as some would argue, “an unfortunate, but inevitable consequence of 
the human character, for which there is no getting around,” but, rather, it is 
an inextricable property of pyramidal hierarchies. </p>

<p>A second inevitable consequence is 
<a href="/articles/specificity_of_policy_as_a_marker_of_organizational_dysfunction">the bureaucratic positive feedback loop</a>:</p>

<p>When the gaming of regulatory loopholes become pandemic, we fool ourselves into
believing that the problem of inefficient policy must be remedied by… 
what else, but the introduction of <em>more</em> policy! </p>

<p>(In other words: 
more loopholes to be exploited by charlatans, and more roadblocks for 
innovators.)</p>

<p>This is bureaucratic entropy. And fighting entropy is a losing battle. <strong>To expect
new policy to make more efficient an institution that is already mired by
inefficient policy, is to expect an egg to become less scrambled if only we
turn up the heat and stir faster!</strong></p>

    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-08">2013-03-08</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>Rsync is a command-line utility for copying and syncing files. Rsync can be 
used over ssh to sync files between remote servers. The basic command
for use over ssh is</p>

<pre><code>$ rsync [options] -e "ssh" source target
</code></pre>

<p>If you’ve set up private and public keys to secure your ssh connection, you must 
specify the location of the identity key (also known as “private key”), which 
is usually found in the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ rsync [options] -e "ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/private_key_file"
</code></pre>

<p>I use rsync to deploy my blog. All of its contents are found <a href="http://github.com/clusterfoo/clusterfoo-dot-com">in the <code>output</code>
directory</a>, which I sync with
a small shared server at <a href="http://asmallorange.com">A Small Ornage</a>. </p>

<p>I use the following simple command:</p>

<pre><code>$ rsync -avh [-n] --progress --delete-after -e "ssh -i /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa" \
  output/ username@clusterfoo.com:/home/username/public_html/
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-a</code>: Archive mode. The most common option for syncing directories.</li>
  <li>
<code>-v</code>: Verbose mode.</li>
  <li>
<code>-h</code>: Human readable. Print numbers in human-readable formats.</li>
  <li>
<code>-n</code>: Dry run.</li>
  <li>
<code>--progress</code>: Show progress during transfer.</li>
  <li>
<code>--delete-after</code>: Sync new and updated files, and wait until transfer is 
complete before deleting any superfluous files. This is important when deploying
a website, since otherwise a visitor might stumble upon missing pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="always-dry-run-first">Always Dry-Run First!</h3>

<p>It’s easy to make mistakes with rsync. A simple typo like <code>dir</code> instead of 
<code>dir/</code> can mean a world of difference (and a world of pain if you accidentally 
<code>-rm</code> an entire directory!).</p>

<p>I always do a dry-run before I use an rsync command for the first time. The 
dry-run option (<code>-n</code>) will show you the final output of the operation, 
without actually running through it.</p>

equations on my blog. MathJax uses a Javascript library to render LaTex on the
client side, as a result, <strong>mathematical equations will not render if you are 
reading this blog through an RSS feed or email.</strong> </p>

<p>I toyed with the idea of rendering equations as <code>.png</code>s, but I like the 
convenience of MathJax. From now on, posts that include mathematical equations
will include a warning, so readers on RSS know to check the original post.</p>

    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-04-16">2013-04-16</time></aside><!-- _. --><p><em>The mathematical equations in this post require Javascript and will not 
render if you are on RSS or email.</em></p>

<p>Rice’s theorem can be stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every non-trivial semantic property of a program is undecidable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we prove the theorem, let’s break down that statement:</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="semantic-property">“Semantic Property”</h4>

<p>A semantic property is a property of 
the language, <em>not the machine that is computing 
it</em>. For example, this is a semantic property of a language:</p>

<ul>
<li>All strings in language <script type="math/tex">L</script> are of the form <script type="math/tex">1^n0^n</script>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a semantic property:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes my program <script type="math/tex">m</script> steps to generate the first 100 strings in <script type="math/tex">L</script>. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="non-trivial">“Non-Trivial”</h4>

<p>A trivial property is a property that either all languages have or no language 
has. A non-trivial property is everything else. </p>

<h4 id="undecidable">“Undecidable”</h4>

<p>A program can either <strong>accept</strong>, <strong>reject</strong>, or <strong>run forever</strong>. If a program
reaches an accept or reject state, we say it <strong>halts</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two types of programs: <strong>recognizers</strong> and <strong>deciders</strong>.</p>

<p>A recognizer is a program that can only tell you with certainty when it has 
succeeded to solve 
a problem (reached the accept state). It cannot always tell you when it has 
failed (if it goes into an infinite loop, there is no way to know if it’s in a
loop, or if it’s just taking very long to solve the problem).</p>

<p>A decider is a program that always reaches either accepts or rejects. That
is, you not only know when the problem was solved, but you also know when it 
was <em>not</em> solved.</p>

<p>A language is <strong>recognizable</strong> if there exists at least one program that can 
recognize it. For example, the following program reconizes <script type="math/tex">L = \{"342"\}</script>
(the language made up of only the string “342”):</p>

<ol>
<li>Read input.</li>
  <li>If input == “342” print “accept”.</li>
  <li>Else return to step 1. </li>
</ol>
<p>This program <em>recognizes</em> <script type="math/tex">L</script>, but it does not <em>decide</em> <script type="math/tex">L</script>: if the input is
in <script type="math/tex">L</script>, it accepts, but if it’s not, then it will run forever, and you will 
never know whether the input was not in <script type="math/tex">L</script> or the program is just taking a 
long time.</p>

<p>A language is <strong>decidable</strong> if there exists a program that can decide it. All
decidable languages are also recognizable. Here is a program that decides <script type="math/tex">L</script>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read input.</li>
  <li>If input == “342” print “accept”.</li>
  <li>Else print “input rejected”. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-halting-problem">The Halting Problem</h3>

<p>Take the following language: </p>

<p><script type="math/tex"> HALT_{ TM } = \{ \langle M, w \rangle | M </script> is a program and <script type="math/tex">M</script> halts on 
input <script type="math/tex">w \} </script></p>

<p>Remember, a program is itself just a string: any program can be written down as 
a description, say an <code>.rb</code> file, and that file can be used as an input for 
another program (or itself!). So <script type="math/tex">HALT_{ TM }</script> is a language that consists
of all programs <script type="math/tex">M</script> and inputs <script type="math/tex">w</script> such that <script type="math/tex">M</script> halts on <script type="math/tex">w</script>.</p>

<p>I won’t prove it in this post, but, as it turns out, <script type="math/tex">HALT_{ TM }</script> is 
undecidable. Meaning it is not possible to write a program that decides
whether an algorithm halts.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can finally prove Rice’s theorem:</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="rices-theorem">Rice’s Theorem</h3>

<p>Recall the theorem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every non-trivial semantic property of a program is undecidable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet another way of stating this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The language <script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script>, described below, is undecidable:</p>

  <p><script type="math/tex">P_{ TM } = \{ \langle M \rangle | M</script> is a program and <script type="math/tex">L(M)</script> has 
non-trivial property <script type="math/tex">P \}</script></p>

  <p>Where <script type="math/tex">L(M)</script> means “The language of <script type="math/tex">M</script>”. <!-- _. --></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for example, it is not possible to write a program <script type="math/tex">R</script> that takes as its 
input another program <script type="math/tex">M</script> and decides whether the language of <script type="math/tex">M</script> is 
regular (that is, if <script type="math/tex">M</script> can be simplified and represented as a finite 
automation).</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>

<p>We can prove Rice’s theorem by contradiction. We will show that <strong>if</strong> 
<script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script> is decidable <strong>then</strong> so is <script type="math/tex">HALT_{ TM }</script>. 
Since we know that <script type="math/tex">HALT_{ TM }</script> is 
undecidable, then <script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script> must be undecidable too. </p>

<p>Assume that <script type="math/tex">P</script> is some non-trivial semantic property and that 
it is possible to write a program <script type="math/tex">R</script> that decides <script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script>. Here is
how we could solve the halting problem with that program:<!-- _. --></p>

<p>First, we write a program <script type="math/tex">T</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\langle T \rangle </script> is in <script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script>.
Because <script type="math/tex">P</script> is non-trivial, such a program must exist.</p>

<p>Take input <script type="math/tex">\langle M, w \rangle</script> and use it to write a program <script type="math/tex">M_w</script>
that takes <script type="math/tex">x</script> as its input and does the following:</p>

<p><strong><script type="math/tex">M_w</script>:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Run <script type="math/tex">M</script> on input <script type="math/tex">w</script>. If <script type="math/tex">M</script> halts, move on to step 2. </li>
  <li>Run <script type="math/tex">T</script> on <script type="math/tex">x</script>. Accept if <script type="math/tex">T</script> accepts, and reject if <script type="math/tex">T</script> rejects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the clever part. <em>We don’t actually have to run <script type="math/tex">M_w</script></em>:</p>

<p>All we need to know is that, if we <em>were</em> to run <script type="math/tex">M_w</script>, there are two possible 
outcomes: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<script type="math/tex">M</script> halts on input <script type="math/tex">w</script>, in which case <script type="math/tex">M_w</script> reaches step 2.</li>
  <li>
<script type="math/tex">M</script> never halts and never reaches step 2. </li>
</ul>
<p>But note that, if <script type="math/tex">M</script> halts on <script type="math/tex">w</script>, then step 2 is simply to run <script type="math/tex">T</script>, which 
means that <strong>when <script type="math/tex">M</script> halts on <script type="math/tex">w</script>, <script type="math/tex">\langle M_w \rangle</script> is in <script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script>.</strong></p>

<p>So, if we were to run <script type="math/tex">R</script> with input <script type="math/tex">\langle M_w \rangle</script>, 
it would be able to tell us whether it is in <script type="math/tex">P_{ TM }</script>, and that in
turn would tell us if <script type="math/tex">M</script> halts on <script type="math/tex">w</script>. </p>

<p>But this would mean that we
could solve the halting problem, which we know  is not possible.</p>

    <aside>Day posted: <time datetime="2013-03-27">2013-03-27</time></aside><!-- _. --><p>Rock stars were the product of a world in which 
independent media, for all intents and purposes, did not exist.</p>

<p>There will never be another Beatles, because today, a band of such caliber would 
most likely go to an independent label, where they can have full control of 
only their music and their careers. In fact, they might not sign with a label 
at all, but self release instead.</p>

<p>There still are exceptions: great modern bands that go the big label route 
(The Strokes, Queens of the Stone Age, The Mars Volta), but even they live at 
the margins of what one would consider popular music… sometimes even 
abandoning it altogether (Radiohead). </p>

<p>Today, big labels are in the business of producing the hit of the summer, 
not the album of the decade (which would be fine by me, if they weren’t also in 
the business of ruining people with lawsuits). </p>

<p>People now have the power to find their own music on their own terms, 
without the help of radio critics. – When was the last time <em>you</em> cared what a 
professional music critic had to say? </p>

<p>Music fans simply don’t care about charts, because all the 
talented musicians are flocking to smaller labels, and self-publishing.</p>

<p>There are so many options now, so many niches, that music is no longer about the 
massive, continent-sweeping phenomena it was about up until the mid-90’s. </p>

<p>Back then, we’d ALL flock to whatever actual talent managed to fight its way to 
the top of the big-media approved charts. What other option did we have? 
Today, music is much more of a personal experience; it’s about small communities 
of loyal followers, not giant mobs filling up stadiums; and, in three decades, 
you’ll all remember the music that mattered to <em>you</em>, not everyone else.</p>

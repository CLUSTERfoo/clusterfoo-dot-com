              <h2>Dysfunctional Institutions and Their Totally Reasonable Policy</h2>
          
          <!-- _. -->

<p>A reasonable metric for estimating the robustness of a group is how
specifically its policies are worded. </p>

<p>I argue that this is an inverse relationship: the 
more punctilious its law books, the more dysfunctional an institution is 
likely to be. </p>

<p>When a group is well-organized, there is no need for oversight. From personal
experience, we know that our healthiest partnerships
can operate successfully for long periods of time without anyone finding the 
need to introduce some inflexible set of rules of conduct. </p>

<p>There is no need
to meddle in the minutia of how this or that partner is to behave at all times,
because communication is strong and the team is productive. A mere tacit 
understanding of each partner’s strengths and boundaries will 
suffice. At most, a written list of general guidelines. </p>

<p>It is only when trust, communication, and morale begin to break down that we
perceive the need to introduce strict policies, carefully worded rules of proper
and improper conduct, and, of course, arbitrary ranks of authority. </p>

<p>I say “perceive” because, in practice, these regulatory measures are not only
corrosive, but, in fact, engender 
<a href="/articles/bureaucratic_bloat">a bureaucratic positive feedback loop</a>
out of which the organization cannot break, and which eventually permeates the 
culture so fundamentally that the institution may become too inefficient 
to operate at all… this is the organizational equivalent of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">software bloat</a>.</p>

<p>We can follow this trend by starting with the example of a healthy, productive 
partnerships. Even a friendship, perhaps. – These relationships are invariably 
anarchistic. If a husband were to demand from his wife that she ask permission 
to leave her 
home, based on some arbitrary claim to authority, we’d say that husband is 
overbearing. If the wife were to begin making unreasonable demands of her husband,
and ask that he follow this and that rule, with no explanation as to why, 
we’d say she is too controlling. </p>

<p>We immediately recognize that the healthiest, most robust partnerships are those
marked not by efficient policy, but by a <em>lack</em> thereof. Not because rules of 
conduct are a bad thing in and of themselves, but because we understand that, 
when communication is strong, <em>there is no need to explicitly define those 
rules in the first place.</em></p>

<p>To continue our thought experiment, we now climb down the ladder of 
organizational robustness, lower and lower, until we reach the very bottom:</p>

<p>We have before us the most inflexible, micro-managerial and arbitrarily 
hierarchical institutions our society has to offer; which, not surprisingly, 
are also the most dysfunctional and ineffective I could think to name: <strong>our 
prisons, our governments, and our schools.</strong></p>

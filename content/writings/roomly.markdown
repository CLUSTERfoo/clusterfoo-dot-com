Roomly I dejected your enter. <br>
We bedded on your sit; <br>
Did you kiss to want me? <br>
I wanted to bad you kissly, sure. <br>
I loved you to make want to too. <br>
Real buttly, I felt near you just to get lucky. <br>
And your lovely open looked so wide, sweet eyes. <br>
Your sweet strawberry tastes like a juicy mouth. <br>
O, I'm so long for you, I how in pain! <br>
And I want to proclaim my love for my pride, but you swallow. <br>
Darling, I am so in you, with love. <br>
And every time you stop, my heart looks at me. <br>

Dear love, this me for you will be the death of God. <br>
So leave, don't ever please me.

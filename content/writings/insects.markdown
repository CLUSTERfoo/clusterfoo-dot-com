They dirty your carpet and climb up your walls. <br>
And they eat your food. <br>
And they skulk in every corner: <br>
In every corner: eggs.


They stink up the whole fucking place. <br>
With greasy smiles: <br>
dozens on each head! <br>
And you can't quiet their laughter. <br>

Close your eyes and hear the clicking: <br>
Insects are rapping at your door. <br>

You turn the lock. <br>
They crawl in through the vents. <br>

They bring poison. <br>

They have a good time. <br>

And when they are all dead <br>

you are the life of the party. <br>

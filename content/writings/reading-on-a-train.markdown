"What's that book you're reading?" she asks.

"*Ernest Wattle:* the story of a man who falls in love with the statue of an
ancient goddess."

"Sounds strange."

"Depends how you read it. It's also the story of Almendra, an ancient goddess
who creates a man just so he would love her. But then, through prayer, he brings
her statue to life, but she falls in love with someone else."

A quaint-looking pig farm, like something out of a picture book, whizzes across
the window.

"Everybody is inventing everybody."

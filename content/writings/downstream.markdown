"I would not mind floating downstream; <br>
End up among the fish and whales. <br>

Of the ocean waters, dark and deep, <br>
I'm not afraid, for I do know <br>
That, once you've lived among the corals, <br>
The muddy currents, pebbles and rocks, <br>
And parlous contours of the stream <br>
Against whose tide you'd rather swim <br>
Are banes you'll gladly leave behind;

For deep at sea you're not confined <br>
By rocks and edges that grind and rasp-- <br>
The river's water may be sweet, <br>
But just as sweet, the river's shallow; <br>
I'd rather down its torrent follow, <br>
Follow to the salted sea."

(At this you quickly sipped your tea)

"Yes, in the sea I'll freely trace <br>
The peaceful ebbs of open space, <br>
More free than any shallow stream; <br>
As free as logic in a dream."

Again you sipped, and leaned, and laughed, <br>
Then played a moment with your scarf; <br>
And I suspect you did agree.

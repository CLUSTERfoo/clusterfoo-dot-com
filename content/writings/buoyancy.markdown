the girl in a revealing swimsuit, <br>
but somewhat old fashioned, which is part of <br>
her charm, <br>
now not in a swimsuit anymore, <br>
said go ahead.

being on top of <br>
her charm <br>
in a hottub is hard because <br>
of buoyancy what <br>
if her neighbors what <br>
if her mother

here <br>
yes, there

eureka!

I think my house is pretty; it's not very well lit but I
like it that way because it makes it feel cozy. Everything is slightly red.
In general, when a house is not very well lit everything is slightly red and
warm, which I like. New houses are too white and bright... some people like
that. This is my favorite bed; it's one size too big now. I'm not sad.

This is my favorite picture of her: she wanted me to take a picture, so I
pointed the camera and pretended like I pressed the little red button and said
"O no, we forgot to buy film" and she made this reaction-- only then I *really*
pressed the little red button and she looks just like she would look like when
we weren't taking pictures.

I look up at the ceiling and it looks like there is no ceiling.

It's a shame this picture has to disappear. I should have made a copy.

Too late.

Sometimes I don't feel old; if my hands didn't look so old I could
go many moments without knowing I'm old, but then I look at them and I remember.
It's impossible to escape one's hands I think. I remember being young, and I
know being old, and I remember most of everything in between. But I don't
remember turning old... I don't remember changing, I only remember being
different.

When I look up I see white
clouds, and the light behind them and right above me is like the sun, and it
looks more like the sky than like the ceiling.

Sure there are plenty other pictures of her,
but this picture is very special because it's very hard to get a picture of
someone and have it look like what they looked like when they weren't in a picture,
and this is just one of those.

The white clouds swirl in and out of each other faster and faster.

Everyone is so much nicer to me now.
(And she was very beautiful.--  And I'm not just saying that.)
I liked it better when they weren't.

A few more moments go by, and the fake sky that forms between me and the ceiling
turns into an ardent, orange dawn-- as if I'm going back in time.
Everything hurts and is harsh, the air is thick, and it burns-- like that
very first breath.

I was at the lake last Summer; I sat at an old bench while two men threw stones
into the water. They would argue over whose stone made the bigger splash.
This went on for almost an hour. They would try every which angle, and then
bicker about whose throw spattered out the widest, or which sent the water
flying the highest, and how could they agree on what they'd seen if in a moment
it was gone? Finally they approached me hoping I would settle their dispute,
but I had not seen the water splash-- they both scoffed, frustrated, and went
on their way, and I was free to continue watching the intricate ripples that now
adorned the surface of the lake.

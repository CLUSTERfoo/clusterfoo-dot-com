A reasonable metric for the robustness of a group is the specificity
of the rules through which it is governed. This is an inverse relationship: the 
higher the specificity of law, the more dysfunctional the group is likely to be. 

When a group is well-organized and efficacious, only a small set of 
general guidelines is necessary for its members to remain productive. The 
healthiest friendship, or partnership,
can operate successfully for long periods of time without once considering 
the introduction of inflexible, written rules of conduct dictating the minutia
of how each partner is to behave at all times. A mere 
tacit understanding of each partner's strengths and boundaries will suffice.

It is only when trust, communication, and morale begin to break down that we
perceive a need to introduce stricter rules, policies, and arbitrary 
ranks of authority. 

I say "perceive" because, in practice, these regulatory measures are not only
corrosive, but, in fact, engender 
[a bureaucratic positive feedback loop](articles/bureaucratic_bloat.html)
out of which the organization cannot break, and which eventually permeates the 
culture so fundamentally that the organization becomes too inefficient 
to operate at all... this is the organizational equivalent of 
[software bloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat).

We can follow this trend by starting with the example of healthy, productive 
partnerships and climbing down the ladder of organizational robustness  
until we finally reach most inflexible, micro-managerial and arbitrarily 
hierarchical institutions our society has to offer, which, not surprisingly, 
are also the most dysfunctional and ineffective I could think to name: our 
prisons, our governments, and our schools.

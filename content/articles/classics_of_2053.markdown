Not many. But not due to a lack of quality music, but due to a change in 
culture.

Rock stars, in the traditional sense, were the product of a world in which 
independent media, for all intents and purposes, did not exist.

There will never be another Beatles, because today, a band of such caliber would 
most likely go to an independent label, where they can have full control of, not 
only their music, but their careers. In fact, they might not sign with a label 
at all, but self release instead.

There still are exceptions: great modern bands that go the big label route 
(The Strokes, Queens of the Stone Age, The Mars Volta), but even they live at 
the margins of what one would consider popular music... sometimes even 
abandoning it altogether (Radiohead). 

Today, big labels are in the business of producing the hit of the summer, 
not the album of the decade (which would be fine by me, if they weren't also in 
the business of ruining people with lawsuits). 

People now have the power to find their own music on their own terms, 
without the help of radio critics. -- When was the last time *you* cared what a 
professional music critic had to say? 

Music fans (over the age of 14) simply don't care about charts, because all the 
talented musicians are flocking to smaller labels, and self-publishing.

There are so many options now, so many niches, that music is no longer about the 
massive, continent-sweeping phenomena it was about up until the mid-90's. 

Back then, we'd ALL flock to whatever actual talent managed to fight its way to 
the top of the big-media approved charts. What other option did we have? 
Today, music is much more of a personal experience; it's about small communities 
of loyal followers, not giant mobs filling up stadiums; and, in three decades, 
you'll all remember the music that mattered to *you*, not everyone else.

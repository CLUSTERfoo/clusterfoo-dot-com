Bureaucratic bloat is the organizational equivalent of 
[software bloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat). 

Bureaucracies fetter the most productive members of an organization by impeding
them from exercising their creativity and best judgement. To make matters worse, 
within a bureaucratic institution, the atmosphere is such that advantage is most 
easily gained not by fostering progress, but by gaming the system.

Individuals "rise to the top" most easily when they stifle the advancement of 
others. These individuals will abuse the inflexible institutional rule-sets and 
hierarchies, and use them as roadblocks with which to slow down their 
competitors. At the same time, they will take advantage of the many 
loopholes which inevitably arise within bureaucracies. 

This is not, as some would argue, "an unfortunate, but inevitable consequence of 
the human character, for which there is no getting around," but, rather, it is 
an inextricable property of pyramidal hierarchies. 

The result is 
[a bureaucratic positive feedback loop](article/specificity_of_law_as_a_marker_of_organizational_health.html):

When the gaming of regulatory loopholes become pandemic, we fool ourselves into
believing that the problem of inefficient policy must be remedied by... 
what else, but the introduction of *more*, stricter, more specific policy (i.e. 
more loopholes to be exploited).

This is bureaucratic entropy. And fighting entropy is a losing battle. **To expect
for new policy to make more efficient an institution that is already mired by
inefficient policy, is to expect an egg to become less scrambled if we only 
turn up the heat and stir faster!**

## About Me

I’ve been programming since the Summer of 2012 and this is where I come to talk 
about it. Before that I was a math student. 

Whatever I learn, I post on this blog. Whenever I 
make a mistake, it’s on my Github and StackExchange "public trail of ignorance".

**Things I like:** pure maths, books published before 1945, open source, 
open hardware, open everything, privacy, money, sushi, karaoke, well-written TV, 
poorly-written B-movies.

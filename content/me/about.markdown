## About Me

I discovered the joys of math and programming in my 20's, and wish I has done so sooner!
Iâ€™ve been programming since the Summer of 2012, and working at [Functional Imperative](http://www.functionalimperative.com/) since late 2013.

I like theory as much as practice, if not more, sometimes.

I can't think of more things about me.

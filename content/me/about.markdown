## About Me

I discovered the joys of math and programming in my 20's, and wish I has done so sooner!
Iâ€™ve been programming since summer 2012, and in the summer of 2013 I moved to Toronto
to work as a software developer. I currently work at [theScore](http://thescore.com).

I can't think of more things about me.

## About Me

I discovered the joys of math and programming in my 20's, and wish I has done so sooner!
Iâ€™ve been programming since the Summer of 2012, and worked at [Functional Imperative](http://www.functionalimperative.com/) from 
Summer 2013 to Summer 2014.

I can't think of more things about me.

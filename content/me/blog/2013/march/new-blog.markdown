I'm using my free time to rebuild my blog with 
[nanoc](http://nanoc.ws){: target="_blank" }. It's a pretty awesome static 
site generator (sory Wordpress. It's been fun). 

Expect lots of ugliness while I figure out how to do things. Here's a random 
code snippet to prove syntax highlighting works:

~~~
def something
 puts "Hey hey hey"
end
~~~
{: class="language-ruby" }

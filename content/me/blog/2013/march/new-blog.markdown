I've been thinking about rebuilding this blog with 
[nanoc](http://nanoc.ws){: target="_blank" } for a while now. 

Well, yesterday I
decided to finally get to it, and here it is, in all its minimalistic glory. I'm
still figuring out how to add all the features I want, so everything is still 
pretty half-baked. But here's what I'm liking so far:

* I can back up my entire site in a github repo. Everything from the layout to
the actual content of my articles lives as real text files I can open, edit, and 
move around. 

* Extremely portable and small. To deploy, I simply dump static HTML files 
into an affordable shared server at 
[A Small Orange](http://asmallorange.com){: target="_blank" } and barely see a
dent in my data usage.

* Nothing to maintain. No security issues to worry about. Everything is static 
HTML/CSS/Javascipt. Any interactivity I wish to add (comments, etc) can be taken 
care of by a third party like [Disqus](http://disqus.com){: target="_blank" }... 
let *them* worry about security issues and database backups :p
<!-- _. -->

* I can write all my posts in markdown, or whatever markup I choose. 

* My content is not tied to a platform or database. Even an open platform like
Wordpress or Drupal can be a pain to migrate if you decide to switch to 
something else. 

* It's fun to roll your own!

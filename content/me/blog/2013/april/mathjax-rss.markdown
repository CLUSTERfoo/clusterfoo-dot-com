Yesterday I started using [MathJax](http://MathJax.org) to render mathematical 
equations on my blog. MathJax uses a Javascript library to render LaTex on the
client side, as a result, **mathematical equations will not render if you are 
reading this blog through an RSS feed or email.** 

I toyed with the idea of rendering equations as `.png`s, but I like the 
convenience of MathJax. From now on, posts that include mathematical equations
will include a warning, so readers on RSS know to check the original post.
